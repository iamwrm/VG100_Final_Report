\section{Need and Validation}

\subsection{Needs}

 Our product is to provide people with convenient ways to get happiness.
 To make our product convenient, the device should meet the needs of:

%\begin{enumerate}[\hspace*{3em}(1)]
\begin{itemize}
\item Portable: The device should be able to be carried anywhere, like an App or a bracelet
\item Low cost: The price should not be a burden for most people
\item Multi-function: There should be more than one kinds of motion detected and more than one types of music produced.
\end{itemize}

 There are also some constrains:

\begin{itemize}
\item Database: To make different functions, we need to build a large database to analyze, which may be too large for an iphone.
\item Budget: Smaller the chip, higher the price.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validation}

 Our device can meet with the criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item For portable, our chip is only 1mm*1.5mm, which can be put into a bracelet.
\item For affordable, our device is only 130 RMB, which is only one thirds of the prices of dancing machines and one tenths of the prices of motion detectors in the market.  So, it will be affordable for most people. 
\item For multi-function, our chip will transmit 9 groups of acceleration per second, quickly enough for detecting motions and creating music. We also simplify 9 numbers to 1 to save space.
\end{itemize}
