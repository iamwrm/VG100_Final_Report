\section{Executive Summary}

Our team members have great passion in dancing and music. Dance and music
promise people a colorful life. However, limited time and space in our daily
life limited our possibility to enjoy this entertainment, and the traditional
dancing machine is too big and expensive. For these reasons, we developed a
product to solve these problems. \\ 

Our product can be accessed by a mobile phone or a PC. First, in mobile phone
part, we use the sensor inside of the iPhone, while in PC part, we use an extra
sensor. Both sensors are used to detect our motion then transfer the data
collected to the terminal. Next the algorithm stored in the terminal will
analyze the data. Finally, the terminal will give out a piece of music according
to the data. We have two types of function, matcher and scaler. On one hand,
matcher can provide the music immediately when you are doing a motion. On the
other hand, scaler can record your motion, then generate a piece of music later.
\\ 

A lot of people will benefit from our design. Our design build a bridge between
music and dance. Both music lovers and dancer lovers can have entertainment in a
city life freely, where time and space is limited.
