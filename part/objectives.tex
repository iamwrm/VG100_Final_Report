\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Difficulties}
\hspace*{2em}Since we divided Part 4\&5 into two parts, the mobile terminal part and the PC terminal part, we will divide the Objective parts into these two parts as well. They share many general objectives. 

\subsubsection{General Difficulties }
\begin{itemize}
\item The determination of a matcher
\item A lack of standard audio source
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mobile Terminal part}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to call the inner sensors in mobile phone
\item The calling of the speaker and the flashlight in mobile phone
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PC Terminal part}
\begin{itemize}
\item The difficulties to transform data from the sensor to the PC terminal
\end{itemize}
