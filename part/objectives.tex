\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Difficulties}
\hspace*{2em}Since we divided Part 4\&5 into two parts, the mobile terminal part
and the PC terminal part, we will divide the Objective parts into these two
parts as well. They share many general objectives. 

\subsubsection{General Difficulties}
\begin{itemize}
\item Have enough audio source to generate variable music
\item Produce a harmonic music
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mobile Terminal part}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to call the inner sensors in mobile phone
\item The calling of the speaker and the flashlight in mobile phone 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PC Terminal part}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transform data from the sensor to the PC terminal
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Objectives of General Difficulties}

We want to have our own sound bank where we can take the certain audio sources
we need. Then basing on this bank, we can combine certain audio sources in a
harmonic way, in which audiences will enjoy this music. 
A standard will be set by an algorithm to determine which kind of music to
generate according to the corresponding motion. 

\subsection{Objectives of Mobile Terminal Part}

We want to use iPhone to detect our motion and then give out music. In other
words, by using iPhone, ideally, users donâ€™t need any other sensors to take or
buy. In some other situations, users can use flash light to add to the fun of
his or her performance. 

\subsection{Objectives of PC Terminal Part}

We use a sensor to deter our motion. The data collected by the sensor will be
transformed to the PC terminal. It need an extra step than mobile phone
terminal.
