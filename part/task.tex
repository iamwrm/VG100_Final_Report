\section{Tasks}
\subsection{General Tasks}
\subsubsection{Collecting and recording audio source}
In order to collect all kinds of audio source, we search the Internet to find some short music with strong rhythm and can be looped. Since we have several modes, different types of music may be useful. Moreover, we use the software Garageband which consists of hundreds of audio source that we need. We record each element we need in the software and then save them for future use.
\subsubsection{Combine each audio source in a harmonic way}
Base on the theory of music such as the modal theory, we develop an algorithm that can generate each audio source in a relatively harmonic way. Since it wonâ€™t change the fact that if your motion is random and your music will also be random, we can only try to reduce the effect of this problem. And further development are still need in the future. 
\subsection{Mobile Terminal Tasks}
\subsubsection{Call the inner sensor in the iPhone}
\subsubsection{Call the speaker and flash light in the iPhone}
\subsection{PC Terminal Tasks}
	\subsubsection{Learn to transfer data from the sensor to the computer by bluetooth}
	First we need to learn the C language, which is used on the Unity platform. Then search for information of serial port communication under the background of C.
