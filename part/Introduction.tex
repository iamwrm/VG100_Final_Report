\par We are UM-SJTU JI freshmen who are taking VG100 course. And successfully
completing project 1, we focus our attention on designing a new product that can
help stressful people relax themselves. Since some of our members have great
interests and talents in dancing, we decide to explore for a convenient way for
daily dancing. Its function is to detect users' motion and create corresponding
music.
