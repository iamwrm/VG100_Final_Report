\section{Budget}
To detect user's motion, we need a sensitive sensor, a Bluetooth developing
board and two batteries to transmit the information of user's motion to
terminals. 
Table 1 shows the costs of our project.
Hyperlinks of these materials are listed in Appendix. 
The total budget is less than 150RMB.
The inexpensive price makes our product affordable for most people.
